# Test Progress Report

## Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for test managers to generate Test Progress Reports at regular intervals. The tool reads the planned test activity document in XML format and the actual test activity executed/non-executed in XLSX format. It then compares both documents and produces detailed reports on "Test Execution," "Product Performance," and "Tester Performance."

## Requirements
As a test manager, the tool is expected to perform the following tasks:

1. Read Planned Test Activity Document (XML):
The tool should be able to read the planned test activity document in XML format.

2. Read Actual Test Activity (XLSX):
The tool should read the actual test activity executed/non-executed in XLSX format.

3. Generate Comparison Reports:
The tool should compare the planned and actual test activities and generate reports on the following:
- Test Execution
- Product Performance
- Tester Performance

## Test Reports
1. Burndown Chart
A burndown chart in testing is a visual representation of the work completed versus the work remaining in a testing project over time. It helps the testing team and stakeholders track the progress of testing activities and provide insights into whether the testing effort is on track to meet its goals.

Example:
Comparison of planned test case execution with actual test case execution to monitor the progress of executed test cases.

2. Test Progress Report
A Test Progress Report is a visualization of the history of the number of test cases passed, failed, not run, etc., every day.

3. Product Progress Report
A Product Progress Report is a visualization of the number of test cases passed, failed, etc., during testing to assess the quality of the product.

4. Product Comparison Report
A Product Comparison Report is a visualization of the number of test cases passed, failed, etc., when tested on multiple products or versions of the product. This report aids in comparing product performance.
